              "'Preface  This book deals with computer architecture as well as computer organization and design. Computer architecture is concerned with the structure and behavior of the various functional modules of the computer and how they interact to provide the processing needs of the user. Computer organization is concerned with the way the hardware components are connected together to form a computer system. Computer design is concerned with the development of the hardware for the computer taking into consideration a given set of specifica~ tions. The book provides the basic knowledge necessary to understand the hardware operation of digital computers and covers the three subjects associated with computer hardware. Chapters 1 through 4 present the various digital components used in the organization and design of digital computers. Chapters 5 through 7 show the detailed steps that a designer must go through in order to design an elementary basic computer. Chapters 8 through 10 deal with the organization and architecture of the central processing unit. Chapters 11 and 12 present the organization and architecture of input-output and memory. Chapter 13 introduces the concept of multiprocessing. The plan of the book is to present the simpler material first and introduce the more advanced subjects later, Thus, the first seven chapters cover material needed for the basic understanding of computer organization, design, and programming of a simple digital computer. The last six chapters present the organization and architecture of the separate functional units of the digital computer with an emphasis ‘on more advanced topics.  ‘The material in the third edition is organized in the same manner as in the second edition and many of the features remain the same. The third edition, however, offers several improvements over the second edition. All chapters  ‘two (6and 10) have been completely revised to bring the material up to date and to clarify the presentation. Two new chapters were added: chapter 9 on pipeline and vector processing, and chapter 13 on multiprocessors. Two sections deal with the reduced instruction set computer (RISC). Chapter 5 has been revised completely to simplify and clarify the design of the basic computer. New problems have been formulated for eleven of the thirteen chapters.  ‘The physical organization of a particular computer including its registers, \\x0c'"
